For (future) server owners
--------------------------

1. Install the mod on the server. Its useless on the client, but you can put it in packs safely.
2. Follow the instructions for players.
3. When you link up a service, copy the code and save it somewere secure.
4. Put the token in your config.

In the case of gamewisp, you will only be able to run one server at a time, because of how the tokens work.
If you need / want more then one server, message us so we can try to find a solution.
